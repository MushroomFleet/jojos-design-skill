# The visual essence of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: A comprehensive style guide

Hirohiko Araki's JoJo's Bizarre Adventure represents one of manga's most distinctive visual languages—a fusion of **Renaissance sculpture, Italian high fashion, and cinematic theatricality** that defies conventional illustration rules. This document extracts the transferable principles underlying Parts 3-5's "peak JoJo" aesthetic for illustration and concept art development.

The core insight: JoJo's visual power comes from treating every artistic element—color, pose, composition, costume—as **emotional communication rather than realistic representation**. Araki's stated philosophy: "I put more emphasis on giving readers different feelings and impressions through different color combinations" captures an approach where impact always trumps consistency.

## The compositional philosophy: Panels as cinematic language

Araki structures his visual storytelling around **ki-sho-ten-ketsu**—the traditional Japanese four-act narrative framework—applied to panel composition. Introduction establishes, development complicates, twist transforms, resolution delivers emotional payoff. Panel *size* correlates directly to *time*: larger panels slow readers down; clustered small panels accelerate tension.

The "manga camera" concept drives Araki's framing decisions. Each panel represents a deliberate camera placement borrowed from film grammar—wide shots establish scale, medium shots capture body language, close-ups deliver emotion. The anime production team noted this so strongly that "completely reproducing the composition and dialogues of the original manga" became essential; Araki's layouts are inseparable from the storytelling.

**Extreme angles serve psychological function.** Low angles (worm's eye) make characters imposing—used consistently for DIO's appearances and Stand reveals. High angles convey vulnerability. Dutch/canted angles create unease, deployed heavily in Part 4's Yoshikage Kira confrontations. The principle: match angle to emotional intent, letting camera position tell the story before dialogue does.

Negative space functions actively in JoJo, not as absence but as compositional force. Empty areas create tension, direct focus, and provide breathing room between intense sequences. Araki uses "implied edges"—breaks in marks and reversed tones—to create continuation illusions while keeping compositions clean. The David Production team described this as theatrical rather than realistic staging: "more like *Mie* in Kabuki"—deliberate, posed moments where characters position for visual impact over natural placement.

## Color as emotional architecture, not visual reality

Araki's most radical principle: **no fixed color schemes exist**. When asked "what color is Jotaro?" during OVA production, Araki confirmed he had "no such concept"—he colors everything "based on calculation" for each specific illustration. Giorno's clothes are pink in Volume 54 but blue in Volume 63. This is intentional.

The documented influence: **Paul Gauguin's Synthetism**. From childhood, Araki appreciated that "the ground could be pink and the trees could be blue." This translates to flat areas of bold color with strong outlines, limited palettes with warm/cold contrast, and color-blocking serving emotional rather than realistic purposes. Additional influences include Pop Art spontaneity and Renaissance painting's stark contrasts.

**Signature palette combinations** recur throughout Parts 3-5:

- **Purple-gold**: The villain/power signature. DIO transitions from brooding purples to godlike yellows. Kira Yoshikage's lighter purple creates "calm feeling of mystery."
- **Pink-blue/cyan**: Protagonist energy. Araki calls "cherry blossom color" paired with "sky blue" his "unbeatable combination."
- **Orange-black-gold**: Part 5's gang identity—Mista in blue and orange, Narancia's orange-black (his name derives from Italian "arancia"/orange).
- **Complementary clashing**: Blue beside pink "exudes more power." High saturation throughout—even calm scenes use vivid color; tension comes from which vivid colors clash.

**Skin tone is similarly unfixed.** Characters like Vanilla Ice and Mariah appear with radically different skin tones across manga, games, and anime. Skin is treated like any other color element—subject to artistic needs rather than locked to realism.

David Production solved the anime challenge of full-color consistency through **"special scene coloring"**: established base color schemes shift dramatically when "character's emotions are greatly shaken" or during climactic moments. Part 4's Morioh features yellow skies, blue trees, and greenish turquoise grass—signaling supernatural wrongness permeating every scene. The animators specifically wanted to preserve interpretive freedom for fans who imagined colors differently while reading black-and-white manga.

## The anatomy of a JoJo pose: Torsion, sculpture, and fashion

The iconic "JoJo pose" emerges from three documented influences working in synthesis: Italian Renaissance sculpture, high fashion editorial photography, and deliberate anatomical exaggeration.

**Michelangelo provides the anatomical foundation.** Araki has been recorded using "Michelangelo: Complete Works" by Lutz Heusinger as direct reference. Specific sculptures referenced include "The Genius of Victory," "Two Wrestlers," and "Crouching Youth." Araki stated the "David" directly inspired Giorno Giovanna's curled hair design. The classical contrapposto stance—weight shifted to one leg creating an S-curve through the body—becomes the starting point for every JoJo pose.

**Bernini pushes poses into theatrical territory.** Araki states he got the idea for "crazy character poses" after seeing "Apollo and Daphne" in Rome. The Baroque sculpture's dynamic tension—bodies caught mid-action yet frozen in eternal tableau—translates directly to JoJo's approach.

**Fashion photography supplies the finishing gesture.** Araki uses women's fashion magazines as reference even for male characters, stating: "Women's fashion models tend to strike more dynamic and expressive poses compared to the simpler stances in men's fashion." Primary sources include Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and Haute Couture editorials. Fashion illustrators **Tony Viramontes** and **Antonio Lopez** provide particularly direct influence—Kars' design nearly duplicates a Viramontes illustration, and Joseph and Caesar's famous face-pressing pose comes from Lopez's "Antonio's People."

The technical formula Araki articulates: **curved center guideline** (spine creating S-curve or extreme arc), **angled hip placement** with weight on one leg, and **interesting elbow placement**. Araki specifically notes: "the placement of the elbows and waist are the most important things when drawing the poses." Elbows should point at "almost unrealistic or improbable" angles. He told animators that "a pose only truly becomes expressive when the body is pushed to extreme exaggeration, even to the point of appearing as though the joints are dislocated."

**Hands function as narrative devices.** Fingers spread wide like "shutter slats," framing faces or pointing dramatically, staying rigid and deliberately positioned. Jotaro's pointing pose borrows from Clint Eastwood—"index locked on target... a line from shoulder to fingertip." Each hand position tells a story; anatomical accuracy matters less than character expression.

The figure style evolves significantly across Parts 3-5. Part 3 represents peak musculature—massive, hyper-defined bodies influenced by Schwarzenegger and Stallone, with Fist of the North Star's legacy still visible. Part 4 transitions toward more realistic proportions; Araki explained that "when I came up with the concept of 'inner power' in the '90s, the bodies of the main characters started becoming more normal-sized." Part 5 arrives at slender "fashion model" physiques—bodies built for fluid poses rather than power display, with tighter-fitting clothing that emphasizes the body's line.

## Fashion design philosophy: Costume as character expression

Araki lists **Gianni Versace** and **Christian Dior** among his "heroes and immense inspirations." His "favorite designer of all time" is **Moschino**, praised for blending "humor with beauty" and using "symbols in designs." The colors throughout JoJo were "influenced by the designs of Versace, Moschino, Missoni and other Italian brands that were very trendy in the '80s when the series began."

**Documented direct references are extensive.** Prosciutto's character design comes from Georgina Grenville in Mario Testino's 1996 Gucci campaign—confirmed by Grenville herself on Instagram. Bruno Bucciarati's hair clips derive from model Marpessa Hennink in Versace Fall/Winter 1992. Giorno's poses reference Claudia Schiffer and Nadja Auermann in Richard Avedon's Versace campaigns. Kira Yoshikage's design pulls from David Bowie at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert.

The Gucci relationship became formal: the 2013 "Jolyne, Fly High with Gucci" collaboration featured Jolyne Cujoh wearing Gucci's Cruise collection in a one-shot manga for SPUR magazine, with window displays at 70+ Gucci locations worldwide. The 2009 "Rohan au Louvre"—commissioned by the museum itself—marked the first manga ever published by Musée du Louvre Editions.

**Maximalist accessory philosophy defines JoJo costume design.** Layered symbolic motifs connect to character identity: Jotaro's anchor and hand symbols represent resilience, Giorno's ladybug motifs reflect Gold Experience's life-creating ability, Rohan's calligraphy pen tips announce his profession. Stand abilities often mirror costume design—Bruno's zipper-covered outfit directly reflects Sticky Fingers' powers.

Gender expression in costume crosses traditional boundaries deliberately. Araki notes: "Even when depicting male characters, I often reference poses and styles used by women." Male characters routinely wear crop tops, skirts, mesh, and form-fitting silhouettes. Female characters receive structured, militaristic designs conveying power. The approach treats fashion as character vocabulary rather than gender signifier.

## Typography and the menacing ゴゴゴゴ: Sound as visual design

JoJo's signature **ゴゴゴゴ (gogogogo)** is technically not an onomatopoeia but a **non-onomatopoeic ideophone (gitaigo)**. Characters don't actually hear the sound; it evokes an *idea* of menace. Related effects include **ドドドド (dodododo)** for tension and impact, and completely invented sounds like **メメタァ (memetaa)** for Zeppeli's frog punch and **ズキュウウウン (zukyuuun)** for emotional shock.

These text elements function as **compositional architecture**, not annotation. Onomatopoeia shapes page layout, sometimes functioning as "walls or architecture" within panels. Lettering style, size, and placement constitute compositional decisions equal to figure placement. Effects frequently break panel borders, creating dynamism and flow. The David Production team felt that onomatopoeia "MUST be faithfully recreated"—leaving them out "would not be JoJo."

The **"To Be Continued" arrow** became internationally iconic: a uniquely-styled arrow pointing left with English text, paired with freeze frames using sepia or chalk-like "Harmony Cel" textures. Combined with Yes's "Roundabout" (1971) in the anime, this ending treatment became a globally recognized meme format—demonstrating how JoJo's graphic design elements transcend their original context.

**Opening sequences** by studio Kamikaze Douga draw on **Saul Bass, Hitchcock title sequences, and James Bond films** (particularly Skyfall) as stated influences. The design philosophy: "Animation that's not just showing characters"—expressing tone through visual design, with typography and graphical elements prioritized alongside character representation. Opening sequences evolve throughout each season: characters added as introduced, villains "invading" the opening with their powers, and special versions (Bites the Dust playing in reverse, Diavolo's time skip affecting visuals).

## David Production's systematization: Translating chaos to animation

Director Naokatsu Tsuda's guiding principle: **"Study JoJo scientifically."** The production team created a comprehensive "Bible" documenting all JoJo elements—onomatopoeia, posing, theatrical dialogue, motion lines, frame layouts—as a guiding document for all subsequent seasons. Producer Hisataka Kasama articulated the core challenge: "If we follow the usual methods of creating animation, we'll end up with 'JoJo's Ordinary Adventure.' JoJo has to be a 'bizarre adventure.'"

**Key technical innovations include:**

- **Dense drawing (密な作画)**: A progressive "battle of density" among animators to capture Araki's detailed linework while maintaining animation-friendly simplification
- **Stage acting approach**: Director Tsuda compared JoJo battles to professional wrestling—announce the move, then demonstrate the outcome, with emphasis on tempo and rhythm of dialogue alongside action
- **Hand-drawn atmospheric effects**: Fog, smoke, and "unidentifiable gases" recreated manually rather than through CG, maintaining manga's illustrative feel
- **Tonal dramatic lighting**: Darkening entire faces while illuminating only eyes for psychological disturbance—a direct manga technique preserved in animation

The **dual director system** combined complementary skills: Naokatsu Tsuda's comedic sensibilities with Kenichi Suzuki's action direction expertise (Seasons 1-2), and Toshiyuki Kato's emphasis on weight and physicality (Season 2-3). Part 5's directors Yasuhiro Kimura and Hideya Takahashi conducted July 2017 location scouting in Italy, aiming to "make it easy for viewers to make a pilgrimage to the holy places."

Part-specific color decisions ensured **each major character maintains distinct color identity**. Giorno changed from manga's navy blue to fuchsia pink specifically "to stand out from team." The goal: no two characters share the same dominant color, aiding readability and creating visual variety within ensemble casts.

## Conclusion: Transferable principles for the image prompt enhancement system

The JoJo visual language emerges from consistent application of several core principles that transcend their manga/anime context:

**For composition**: Treat every frame as a camera placement decision. Match extreme angles to emotional intent—low angles for power, canted angles for unease. Use negative space actively to create tension and direct focus. Allow theatrical staging to override naturalistic positioning.

**For color**: Serve emotion rather than reality. Establish "designated colors" for each character reflecting personality, but shift palettes freely during emotional peaks. Maintain high saturation throughout—tension comes from which vivid colors clash, not from muting. The "unbeatable combination" (cherry blossom pink + sky blue) and complementary clashing (purple-gold, pink-green) create reliable impact.

**For figure work**: Begin with curved center guidelines creating S-curves through the spine. Prioritize elbow and waist placement over anatomical accuracy. Push poses "to the point of appearing as though joints are dislocated" for maximum expressiveness. Reference women's fashion photography regardless of character gender. Hands tell stories—treat finger positioning as narrative communication.

**For costume design**: Apply maximalist accessory philosophy where "more is more." Layer symbolic motifs connecting to character identity and abilities. Cross traditional gender boundaries in fashion vocabulary. Reference specific luxury fashion campaigns for grounded surrealism.

**For typography integration**: Treat text as compositional element equal to figures. Scale indicates intensity. Allow text to break conventional boundaries and shape page architecture. Develop recognizable ideophones (mood-evoking text) rather than limiting to literal onomatopoeia.

The underlying philosophy unifying all elements: **conventional approaches produce ordinary results**. Every artistic choice in JoJo prioritizes impact and emotional truth over realistic consistency—creating a visual language that is unmistakably, transferably "bizarre."
