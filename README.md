## 🎨 What's Inside

### Grounding Document
Deep research into Araki's visual principles across manga and anime (Parts 3-5 focus):

- **Compositional Philosophy** — Panel-as-camera techniques, extreme angles, negative space
- **Color Theory** — Emotion-driven palettes, signature combinations (purple-gold villain, pink-cyan protagonist)
- **Pose Language** — S-curve spines, expressive elbows, hands as narrative devices
- **Fashion Design** — Versace/Moschino/Dior influences, maximalist accessories, symbolic motifs
- **Typography Integration** — Menacing ゴゴゴ as compositional architecture
- **David Production's Methods** — Anime adaptation techniques and color systematization

### Image Enhancement Agent (t2i-Araki-ENH.md)
A prompt enhancement system that transforms basic inputs like:

> *"A man in a suit"*

Into dramatic specifications:

> *"Dramatic fashion illustration style, tall man in sharp purple double-breasted suit with gold chain accessories striking an extreme contrapposto pose. His spine curves in an exaggerated S-line, weight shifted entirely to his left leg, right elbow bent at an almost impossible angle framing his shadowed face. Only his intense eyes catch the light against theatrical darkness. Bold complementary color scheme—deep violet fabric against golden hour warmth. Low angle shot emphasizing imposing height and authority. High saturation, clean graphic linework with Renaissance anatomical definition."*

### Claude Code Skill (jojos-design.skill)
Provides three advisory modes:

1. **Markdown Plan Enhancement** — Reviews design docs, flags pose opportunities, suggests palettes
2. **Narrative Illustration Advisory** — Transforms flat briefs into dramatic visual specifications
3. **Storyboard Enhancement** — Maps shots to composition doctrine, recommends theatrical staging

## 🔧 How This Was Built

### Phase 1: Deep Research
Comprehensive web research into Hirohiko Araki's artistic methodology, covering:
- Araki's own statements from interviews and his book *Manga in Theory and Practice*
- Art historical influences (Michelangelo, Bernini, Gauguin)
- Fashion photography references (Vogue, Versace campaigns, Antonio Lopez)
- David Production's anime adaptation notes from official production documents
- Academic analyses of JoJo's visual language

### Phase 2: Principle Extraction
Distilled research into **transferable principles** organized by creative domain:
- Composition doctrine with psychological angle mapping
- Color philosophy with role-based palette recommendations
- Pose language with specific anatomical guidance
- Fashion design philosophy with symbolic motif patterns

### Phase 3: Enhancement System
Created the `t2i-Araki-ENH.md` prompt enhancement template:
- Adapted from a base enhancement system structure
- Integrated all extracted principles into actionable rules
- Developed five worked examples demonstrating full principle application
- Added intensity levels and mood indicators for flexible application

### Phase 4: Skill Packaging
Built the Claude Code skill following the skill-creator framework:
- Structured YAML frontmatter with comprehensive trigger descriptions
- Created quick reference tables for rapid consultation
- Bundled grounding and enhancement documents as references
- Validated and packaged into distributable `.skill` format
